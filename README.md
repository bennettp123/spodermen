# Spodermen

A dumb site crawler to highlight broken links and faulty routes. 

Searches for `href` attributes in HTML content and follows any links on the
same domain. Reports the HTTP status code, content length and request duration
of all crawled URLs.


## Usage

	$ ./spodermen <entrypoint_url>
